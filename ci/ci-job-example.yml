# Example CI job for testing PRs
# This shows multiple PRs at the same time
# however normally only one would be done per job

header:
  version: 9
  # We include the base job here
  includes:
    - genericarm64.yml

# override the source of the layers
# kas will not pull directly from the SHA of the PR commit
# the repo and branch of the PR can be found from th gh command
# gh pr status --json "headRefName,headRepository,headRepositoryOwner" #49
# The info below is from meta-openamp #49
repos:
  layers/poky:

  layers/meta-openamp:
    url: https://github.com/wmamills/meta-openamp.git
    refspec: wam-update-open-amp-lic-md5

# override the commit of these source repos
# for libmetal and open-amp BRANCH must be blank
#   the recipe .inc file will add nobranch=1
# for openamp-system-reference we explicitly add nobranch=1 here
# NOTE: any override has higher priority than the base var name
#   therefore these work even if the base recipe has = and not ?=
# The commits below are:
#   libmetal #302
#   open-amp #605
#   openamp-system-reference #45
# (They were valid at the time but may not be when you try this)
